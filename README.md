This is started off as a school-based assignment under the course COMP1127: Introduction to Computing II at University of the West Indies, Mona.
Down below is the project description. The project PDF file can also be found in the repository.

# Youba Project
 Youba Ltd. is a startup company that aims to revolutionize the local public transportation by introducing a brand new way for travellers to connect with drivers. Users only need to have a cellphone to utilize the service. Given your knowledge of ADTs, Youba Ltd. has contracted you to implement the platform for their service.

The project was completed and submitted, but I decided to take it a step further and improve upon it. So far there are 3 versions of the project. More in detail about each version down below.
